# üé• Video Processing System

This project is a video processing system that enables users to upload videos, processes them into meaningful segments using an ML service, and displays the results via a web interface.

## üöÄ Key Features

-	Frontend:
  -	A simple and user-friendly web interface for uploading videos and viewing results.
-	Backend:
  -	Built with Go for performance and scalability.
  -	Powered by Gin for routing and Zap for structured logging.
-	Asynchronous Processing:
  -	Video tasks are queued using RabbitMQ, ensuring smooth processing.
  -	Background worker processes tasks with a Python ML service.
-	Data Storage:
  -	MongoDB for storing processed video results.
  -	PostgreSQL for tracking video processing statuses.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Project

1.	Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git  
cd your-repo-name  
```  
2.	Install Docker  
Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. Get them from Docker‚Äôs official site.  
3.	Check Ports  
Ensure these ports are free or update docker-compose.yml if needed:  
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: 8000  
	‚Ä¢	Backend: 8080  
	‚Ä¢	RabbitMQ: 5672 (15672 for management)  
	‚Ä¢	MongoDB: 27017  
	‚Ä¢	PostgreSQL: 5432  
4.	Start Services  
Run:  
```
docker-compose up --build  
```  
This starts all containers and links services.  
5.	Access the App  
-	Open http://localhost:8000 (or your specified frontend port), upload a video, and wait for processing.  
6.	View Results  
-	Use the Results section to input the Processing ID and see the segmented data.  
7.	Stop Services  
Run:  
```
docker-compose down  
```

## üìà Future Enhancements

-	Full integration with advanced ML models for better video analysis.  
-	GPU acceleration to improve processing speed.  
-	Enhanced frontend visualization for a richer user experience.
