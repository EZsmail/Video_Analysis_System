# üé• Video Processing System

This project is a video processing system that enables users to upload videos, processes them into meaningful segments using an ML service, and displays the results via a web interface.

# üöÄ Key Features

	## ‚Ä¢	Frontend:
	‚Ä¢	A simple and user-friendly web interface for uploading videos and viewing results.
	## ‚Ä¢	Backend:
	‚Ä¢	Built with Go for performance and scalability.
	‚Ä¢	Powered by Gin for routing and Zap for structured logging.
	## ‚Ä¢	Asynchronous Processing:
	‚Ä¢	Video tasks are queued using RabbitMQ, ensuring smooth processing.
	‚Ä¢	Background worker processes tasks with a Python ML service.
	## ‚Ä¢	Data Storage:
	‚Ä¢	MongoDB for storing processed video results.
	‚Ä¢	PostgreSQL for tracking video processing statuses.

# üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

	1.	Frontend: Users upload videos via the web interface.
	2.	Backend:
	‚Ä¢	Receives and queues the video for processing.
	‚Ä¢	Fetches results and status updates from MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
	3.	Worker:
	‚Ä¢	Processes the video into segments using Python ML models.
	‚Ä¢	Saves results in MongoDB.
	‚Ä¢	Updates the status in PostgreSQL.
	4.	Frontend: Displays the segmented video results based on a unique processing ID.

# üìà Future Enhancements

	‚Ä¢	Full integration with advanced ML models for better video analysis.
	‚Ä¢	GPU acceleration to improve processing speed.
	‚Ä¢	Enhanced frontend visualization for a richer user experience.
